# iosnoop - trace block device I/O.
#           Written using Linux ftrace.
#
# This traces disk I/O at the block device interface, using the block:
# tracepoints. This can help characterize the I/O requested for the storage
# devices and their resulting performance. I/O completions can also be studied
# event-by-event for debugging disk and controller I/O scheduling issues.
#
# USAGE: ./iosnoop [-hst] [-d secs] [-p pid] [-n name]
#
# REQUIREMENTS: FTRACE CONFIG, block:block_rq_* tracepoints (you may
# already have these on recent kernels).
#
# OVERHEAD: By default, iosnoop works without buffering, printing I/O events
# as they happen (uses trace_pipe), context switching and consuming CPU to do
# so. This has a limit of about 10,000 IOPS (depending on your platform), at
# which point iosnoop will be consuming 1 CPU. The "-d secs" mode uses buffering,
# and can handle much higher IOPS rates, however, the buffer has a limit of
# about 50,000 I/O, after which events will be dropped. You can tune this with
# bufsize_kb, which is per-CPU. Also note that the "-n" option is currently
# post-filtered, so all events are traced.
#
# This was written as a proof of concept for ftrace. It would be better written
# using perf_events (after some capabilities are added), which has a better
# buffering policy, or a tracer such as SystemTap or ktap.
